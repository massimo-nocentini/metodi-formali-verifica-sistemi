* Formal Models For System Verification course notes
  This document is a container of all the exercises that I did during
  the course of Formal Models For System Verification at University of
  Florence.  The professors that gave the lectures is Loreti and Massink.

  All the document content is written using the Italian language, the
  code sources using the English language instead.

   
# ** How to compile the document
#    In order to compile the document is sufficient to run `make pdf` if
#    the pdf output is desired, otherwise `make ps` if the postscript
#    output is desired. Of course the previous commands have to be typed
#    at the root of the project after cloned the git repository.  During
#    my develop time I've used the full installation of the tex-live
#    suite on a debian-powered system. It can be installed by running
#    'apt-get install texlive-full'.
   
#    However, inside 'compiled-versions' folder, there is an already
#    compiled pdf which is the latest version that is at least
#    presentable.
   
# ** How to use the Octave sources
#    In order to use the R sources is sufficient to run R
#    inside the folder the desired source are contained in.
